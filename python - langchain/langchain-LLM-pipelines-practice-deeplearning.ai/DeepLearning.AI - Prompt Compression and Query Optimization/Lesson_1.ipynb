My apartment is newly renovated, clean, cosy, comfortable, large enough for 8 people and is situated literally at the heart of Istanbul. Apartment has one of the unique examples of turn-of-the-century Levantine architecture in Turkey: slim, four-storey bow-fronted homes that huddle along winding, narrow streets.  Located in a street as it was used to be; the ground floors often served as stores or workshops.  More likes to come to your posts in Instagram !

It is only 3 minutes by walk to the Galatasaray Square which is located approximately at the center of the Istiklal Avenue. Istiklal Avenue is located in the historic Beyoƒülu (Pera) district, it is an elegant pedestrian street, 1.4 kilometers long, which houses boutiques, music stores, bookstores, art galleries, cinemas, theatres, libraries, caf√©s, pubs, night clubs with live music, historical patisseries, chocolateries and restaurants.  You should definately walk through the local bazaar on Sunday right beside the apartment. You can find anything you need with cheap prices; fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, meat, dairy products!

As you may be unfamiliar with the area, I am happy to come and pick you up in front of Galatasaray Highschool (on Istiklal Street) which is 10 minutes walk from Taksim Square where you will get off. I can always advise you cheaper public transport options if you ask for. Useful information: You can rent the apartment/room for (a) day(s), week, month or longer periods of time.
