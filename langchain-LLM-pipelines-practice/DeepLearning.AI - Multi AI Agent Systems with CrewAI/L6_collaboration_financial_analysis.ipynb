      "\n",
      "To start off, let's take a look at the recent developments in AI regulation. In May 2024, the Council of the European Union gave the final green light to the Artificial Intelligence Act, a groundbreaking law that aims to harmonize rules on artificial intelligence. This act is the first worldwide regulation on AI and is set to have a significant impact on the use of AI in the EU.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the EU's AI regulation is already making waves internationally. Introduced in late September 2021, the EU AI Act is the world's first comprehensive AI law. It divides AI technology into categories of risk, with varying levels of regulation depending on the risk level. This regulation is designed to ensure the ethical and legal use of artificial intelligence within the EU.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the EU's efforts, the United States has also been active in AI regulation. Different states in the US have been passing laws to regulate the use of AI, with a focus on issues such as bias audits of AI-enabled tools. The global landscape of AI regulation is constantly evolving, with new laws and regulations being introduced to address the challenges posed by artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an advanced student, it is important to stay informed about the latest developments in AI regulation. Understanding these regulations will not only help you navigate the ethical and legal implications of AI but also prepare you for a future where artificial intelligence plays an increasingly prominent role in society.\n",
      "\n",

      "Welcome to today's conversation lesson on the topic of new AI regulation. Today, we will discuss the latest updates and regulations surrounding artificial intelligence in the European Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start off, let's take a look at the recent developments in AI regulation. In May 2024, the Council of the European Union gave the final green light to the Artificial Intelligence Act, a groundbreaking law that aims to harmonize rules on artificial intelligence. This act is the first worldwide regulation on AI and is set to have a significant impact on the use of AI in the EU.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the EU's AI regulation is already making waves internationally. Introduced in late September 2021, the EU AI Act is the world's first comprehensive AI law. It divides AI technology into categories of risk, with varying levels of regulation depending on the risk level. This regulation is designed to ensure the ethical and legal use of artificial intelligence within the EU.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the EU's efforts, the United States has also been active in AI regulation. Different states in the US have been passing laws to regulate the use of AI, with a focus on issues such as bias audits of AI-enabled tools. The global landscape of AI regulation is constantly evolving, with new laws and regulations being introduced to address the challenges posed by artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an advanced student, it is important to stay informed about the latest developments in AI regulation. Understanding these regulations will not only help you navigate the ethical and legal implications of AI but also prepare you for a future where artificial intelligence plays an increasingly prominent role in society.\n",
